This is an ongoing project to create a game in which the player controls a pirate crew, both with daily decisions on board and outside of combat. I have a vision of it in which when it is finished it will feature:
- **Relationships between crewmembers and yourself** - A pirate ship is a crammed space, and all kinds of conficts can erupt. You will gain and loose allies depending on your decisions. Additionally actions in combat will also affect the relationship.
- **Battles with multiple ways to win** - There are many ways in which pirates can get loot from a ship. Depending on the crew, they might be able to stealth their way in, snipe some crewmembers before melee combat or just blow them all to bits with a good gun crew and collect the pieces.
- **Pirating is more than fighting** - Pirates were not always bloodthirsty, they were on it for themoney in almost all cases. 
This is why they would normally give their targets the opportunity to surrender and just give them their stuff without damages to pay for. Mannaging the "brand" part of the pirate enterprise will also affect how rich everybody gets.

What exists right now:
 - Procedurally generated pirates with modular clothing, weaponry and facial features, as well as randomized name and stats.
 - Controls for the player to switch between controlling his avatar and entering into order-mode, where he can select his crew
 - Tavern recruiting, where the player can choose who he wants to sail with
 - Battle scene, where the chosen crew spawns in against random enemies
 
 What will exist soon: 
  - Simple combat and health system
  - Some orders (cannons, ropes, retreat, steal)
  - Relationship meter between crewmembers
  - Traits with strengths and weaknesses
  - Simple randomized events (choose what to improve, pay to get in-combat bonuses, unexpected losses)
  
  
 What will exist further down the line:
  - Assigning crewmembers to battle positions / man equipment pre-combat
  - Complex environment with ship decks, water, etc.
  - Complex randomized events (plots, factions, assassinations, nemesis)
  - Improved and more varied orders (hide, search, swim underwater)
  - Combat actions affecting relationships (save unit from enemy, complete orders, overperform in combat)
